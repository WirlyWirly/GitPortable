## Installing

The preferred method of installing Git Portable is the `.paf.exe` installer ([why?](https://portableapps.com/about/what_is_a_portable_app#whypaf)). It will download Git for Windows as part of the install process.

### Manual Installation

If you prefer, you can alternatively install Git Portable manually:

1. Copy the `GitPortable` directory from this repository to a location of your choice.
2. Download Git for Windows Portable ("thumbdrive edition") from <https://git-scm.com/download/win> and extract it to the `GitPortable\App\Git` directory.
3. Run the following command to complete the installation:
```
"GitPortable\App\Git\git-bash.exe" --no-needs-console --hide --no-cd --command=post-install.bat
```
The manual installation instructions can also be used to update the version of Git within an existing Git Portable installation.

### Compiling to `.paf.exe`

If you would like to create the `.paf.exe` file from this source:

1. Copy the `GitPortable` directory from this repository to a location of your choice.
2. Download and install the [**PortableApps.com Installer**](https://portableapps.com/apps/development/portableapps.com_installer)
    * Not to be confused with the [**PortableApps.com Platform**](https://portableapps.com/news/2026-07-07--portableapps.com-platform-30.4.2-released), which is the interface that opens when you click the PortableApps tray icon.
3. From the `PortableApps.com Installer` window, select this source folder, click `Go`, and wait for the `.paf.exe` to be generated. It can now be installed through the **PortableApps.com Platform**
